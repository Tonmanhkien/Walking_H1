## Walking H1

This project trains and runs a Unitree H1 locomotion policy in IsaacLab / Isaac Sim using a PPO implementation written from scratch . It also supports interactive keyboard control for inference and can be extended to test different simulation environments (rough terrain, flat terrain, USD worlds like warehouse/office/hospital).
